#### 017 - Flutter NewsAPI.org:

Flutter NewsAPI is a project which is created to fetch the data from the NewsAPI.org and listing it using the Cached Network Image, HTTP and WebView Flutter plugins, so that we will be able to create a News Application in a limited amount of time.

#### Unique Features of the Application:
* [✅]Widgets created for the UI are like as Card, Hero, Animation, Positioned.
* [✅] Parsed the data using **JSON Decode** which helped to bring the data from the API in the form of List.
* [✅]Map is an data structure which is used for passing it through the function.
* [✅] Live Working Project
* [✅] Widgets used like ListTile, ListView Builder, Center, Text and Circle Avatar Widgets
* [✅] Dependencies used are as follows:
  * flutter:
        sdk: flutter

<!-- * [❌] Everything is static right now, no API integration done on it. -->
 
Everything is working quite fine and intutive.
