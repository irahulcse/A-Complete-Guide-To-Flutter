Hey, Everyone!

#54Application
I'm happy to share the update the in Project(Complete Guides to Flutter). Today I had created my 54's App, Tensorflow Lite using Dog/Cat Classifier. In this basically I had used the Tensorflow lite to create the Classifier to distinguish between Dog and Cat. 

Unique Features of the Application:

    [✅] Used Kaggle Dataset of Cat/Dogs.
    [✅] Tensorflow Lite had been used to do the classification.
    [✅] Used around more than 2000 image each for Dog and Cat .
    [✅] Prediction percentage is overall 90%.
