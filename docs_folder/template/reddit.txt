Complete Guide To Flutter Project(#100FlutterAppChallenge)
Hey, Everyone!
#55Application
I'm happy to share the update the in Project(Complete Guides to Flutter). Today I had created my 55's App, #  Flower Classifier using Tensorflow Flite using Flutter:boom:. 
Created a Flower Classifier which can be used to create the model which can be used to find the difference between them 
Learnt about the following:
* [✅] Used Kaggle Dataset of different flowers.
* [✅] Tensorflow Lite had been used to do the classification.
* [✅] Trained the data on more than 10000 images of different flowers.
* [✅] Average Accuracy is around 92%.
As stated, in the earlier post, I am trying to keep my promise to the Reddit Community to push one app every day. Hope to maintain this continuity until my 100 Apps.
